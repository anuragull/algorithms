## Introduction

This directory we will cover different linked list implementation and problems.

## Problems

* [ ] Definition
* [ ] Operation - insert
* [ ] Operation - find
* [ ] Operation - remove
* [ ] circular list
* [ ] doubly linked list
* [ ] Mid-point of a linked list
* [ ] Find Node Kth from the end
* [ ] Reverse a list
* [ ] Merge a two list
* [ ] Find palindromes in a list
* [ ] Find loops in a linked list
* [ ] Test for overlapping lists
* [ ] Remove Duplicates
* [ ] Remove duplicates without buffer
* [ ] Even Odd Merge
* [ ] Implement cyclic shifts
* [ ] Partition a list around a value

## Strategies

1. Runner technique : use two pointer that start at different times,
1. Recursive Solution : A lot of problems can be solved using Recursive Solution
