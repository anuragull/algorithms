MST - Prims algorithm 
Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST. 
Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. 
Initialize all key values as INFINITE. Assign the key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first. 
While mstSet doesnâ€™t include all vertices 
Pick a vertex u which is not there in mstSet and has a minimum key value. 
Include u in the mstSet. 
Update the key value of all adjacent vertices of u. 
To update the key values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. F
or every adjacent vertex v, if the weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, update the key value as the weight of u-v
